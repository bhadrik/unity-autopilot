# Source File Origins and Adaptations

This project utilizes several source files originally taken from the [unity-mcp](https://github.com/justinpbarnett/unity-mcp) repository by Justin P. Barnett as a foundational base. 

All these files have since been modified and adapted to meet the specific requirements of this current project.
